# Data_Cleaning_USA_Market

This is a group task involving a data set hosted on Kaggle that has been scraped from the web, about US data science hires in 2018 (ie pre-covid!). 
The author wanted to look at some specific questions:
1.	Who gets hired? What kind of talent do employers want when they are hiring a data scientist?
2.	Which location has the most opportunities?
3.	What skills, tools, degrees or majors do employers want the most for data scientists?

The main challenge was to use SQL and/or Python to clean, wrangle and generally reshape the data to make it straightforward to analyse from.  
The insights found have been summarised in a one-pager infographic, describing what was learnt from the data and what the gaps in the data or limitations of it were.
